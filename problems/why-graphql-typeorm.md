# Why We Use GraphQL/TypeORM

NestJS works really well with GraphQL and TypeORM. Here are some introductions to these technologies:

1. NestJS is a Node.js-based backend framework that provides a set of abstraction layers that allow developers to build scalable, modular applications faster. It uses Angular-like dependency injection, modularity, and controller concepts to help developers organize and manage code more easily.

2. GraphQL is an API query language that lets clients specify what data is needed, reducing the size of network requests and data transfers. It also provides some powerful tools, such as automatic generation of API documentation, type checking and data validation and other functions.
3. TypeORM is a TypeScript-based object-relational mapping (ORM) framework that helps developers handle database operations more easily. It supports a variety of databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, and provides a set of powerful APIs that make it easier for developers to perform operations such as query, insert, update, and delete.

Combining these technologies, the following advantages can be obtained:

1. Extensibility: NestJS's modular architecture and dependency injection mechanism make the application easier to expand and maintain.
2. Flexibility: The flexibility of GraphQL enables clients to query data as needed without having to rely on predefined REST APIs.
3. Type safety: The combination of TypeORM and TypeScript can provide type-safe database operations and code writing.
4. Overall, using NestJS with GraphQL and TypeORM makes it easier for developers to build scalable, flexible, and type-safe applications.
