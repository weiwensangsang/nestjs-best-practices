# Framework: a JavaScript Version Spring



### Diffs between NestJS and Spring

NestJS and Spring share many similarities in their design and implementation because NestJS was inspired by Spring. NestJS is a Node.js framework based on TypeScript that provides features similar to Spring, such as dependency injection and aspect-oriented programming (AOP). This results in code structures that are very similar between NestJS and Spring, as they both follow the same design patterns and principles.

Specifically, NestJS and Spring both adopt a design pattern based on inversion of control (IoC) and dependency injection (DI). This pattern allows developers to separate the dependencies between objects from the code and let the framework handle these dependencies. This approach improves the testability and maintainability of the code.

In addition, NestJS also provides features similar to Spring Boot, such as auto-configuration and fast application startup. This makes NestJS and Spring share similar workflows and development experiences when building web applications.

In summary, NestJS and Spring share many similarities in their design and implementation, which makes it easy for developers to transition from Spring to NestJS or vice versa.





### Pros and Cons about NestJS

NestJS is a framework for building scalable and efficient server-side applications using Node.js. Here are some of its pros and cons:

Pros:

1. Modular architecture: NestJS has a modular architecture that makes it easy to organize your application into different modules, which can be easily reused and shared across different projects.
2. Easy to learn: NestJS is built on top of familiar technologies such as Node.js and TypeScript, making it easy to learn for developers who are already familiar with these technologies.
3. Strongly-typed: TypeScript is a strongly-typed language, and NestJS takes full advantage of this feature. It provides a lot of benefits such as better code readability, type checking at compile-time, and better code organization.
4. Dependency injection: NestJS provides a built-in dependency injection system that makes it easy to manage your application's dependencies and reduce the amount of boilerplate code you need to write.
5. Testing support: NestJS has built-in support for unit testing and integration testing, making it easy to write and run tests for your application.

Cons:

1. Learning curve: NestJS has a steep learning curve, especially for developers who are new to Node.js and TypeScript.
2. Boilerplate code: NestJS can generate a lot of boilerplate code, especially if you're using it for a small project. This can be overwhelming for some developers.
3. Performance: NestJS is built on top of Node.js, which is not known for its performance. This means that NestJS applications may not be as fast as applications built with other frameworks.
4. Limited community support: While NestJS has a growing community, it is still relatively small compared to other Node.js frameworks such as Express.js.



### Dependency Injection

Nest is built on a powerful design pattern, commonly known as dependency injection. Refers to the dependency of a service, which does not require manual settings by the user, but is injected into it by the framework. Users only need to declare dependencies. The framework will inject the corresponding services according to the dependencies.

In `Nest`, thanks to the **TypeScript** feature, managing dependencies is very easy as they are only resolved by type. In the example below, `Nest` resolves `catsService` by creating and returning an instance of `CatsService` (or, in the normal case of singletons, returning an existing instance if it has already been requested elsewhere ). Resolve this dependency and pass it to the controller's constructor (or assign to the specified property):

```typescript
constructor(private readonly catsService: CatsService) {}
```



Spring implements dependency injection through reflection mechanism. When the Spring container creates a Bean object, it will use the reflection mechanism to find other objects that the object depends on, and automatically inject these objects into the object.

The Nest implementation is similar.
