# How to Deploy with Docker/AWS Lambda/Kubernetes

To deploy a NestJS application using Docker, AWS Lambda, or Kubernetes, you can follow these general steps:

1. Dockerize your NestJS application by creating a Dockerfile that specifies the base image, installs dependencies, and copies your application code into the container.
2. Build the Docker image and push it to a container registry such as Docker Hub or AWS ECR.
3. For AWS Lambda, create a serverless function and configure it to use the Docker image as a runtime.
4. For Kubernetes, create a deployment and specify the Docker image as the container image for the pod.
5. Configure any necessary environment variables and secrets for your application.
6. Set up any necessary networking and load balancing configurations.
7. Deploy your application to your chosen platform.

Here are some more detailed steps for each platform:

Docker:

1. Create a Dockerfile for your NestJS application. Here's an example:

```
FROM node:14-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install --production

COPY . .

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

1. Build the Docker image:

```
docker build -t my-app .
```

1. Push the image to Docker Hub:

```
docker push my-docker-username/my-app:latest
```

AWS Lambda:

1. Create a Dockerfile for your NestJS application. Here's an example:

```
FROM node:14-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install --production

COPY . .

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

1. Build the Docker image:

```
docker build -t my-app .
```

1. Push the image to AWS ECR:

```
codeaws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

docker tag my-app:latest <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest

docker push <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest
```

1. Create a serverless function using the AWS Lambda console or CLI and specify the Docker image as the runtime.
2. Set up any necessary environment variables and secrets for your application.
3. Deploy your function to AWS Lambda.

Kubernetes:

1. Create a Kubernetes deployment configuration file. Here's an example:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app
        image: my-docker-username/my-app:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
```

1. Apply the configuration file to your Kubernetes cluster:

```
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

1. Set up any necessary environment variables and secrets for your application.
2. Set up networking and load balancing configurations for your application. This may involve creating a Kubernetes service.
3. Deploy your application to Kubernetes.

These are just general steps, and the specifics of deploying to Docker, AWS Lambda, or Kubernetes will depend on your specific application and requirements.
