Express and NestJS: Relationship, Differences, and Connections

Express and NestJS are both Node.js frameworks used to build server-side applications. Express is a very popular framework that has been around for a long time. NestJS, on the other hand, is a relatively new framework that offers some new features and concepts while leveraging the advantages of TypeScript.

Here are some relationships, differences, and connections between Express and NestJS:

1. Relationship: NestJS is built on top of Express, so it inherits many of Express's features. In NestJS, you can still use Express middleware and plugins, but it also provides some of its own middleware and plugins that are more powerful than Express.
2. Differences: The biggest difference is that NestJS introduces many new concepts, such as dependency injection, modularization, and aspect-oriented programming, which can help you better organize your code. In addition, NestJS provides some tools to simplify common tasks, such as automatically generating documentation and testing.
3. Connections: Although NestJS and Express have many differences, they still have many similarities. For example, they can both be used to build RESTful APIs, support middleware and plugins, and so on. If you are already familiar with Express, learning NestJS should not be too difficult because their APIs are very similar.

In conclusion, if you are looking for a lightweight, simple-to-use framework, Express may be the better choice. But if you need more features and help organizing your code, NestJS may be the better choice.



### Questions

- What is the Express.js package?

  - Express.js is a popular open-source web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of features for building web and mobile applications, such as routing, middleware support, and template engines. Express.js simplifies the process of creating web applications by providing a high-level, minimalistic interface to Node.js functionality.

- How do you create a simple Express.js application?

  - To create a simple Express.js application, you need to follow these steps:

    - Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.

    - Create a new directory for your application and navigate into it using the terminal or command prompt.

    - Run the command `npm init` to create a new `package.json` file for your application.

    - Install Express.js by running the command `npm install express`.

    - Create a new file called `index.js` and add the following code:

      ```javascript
      const express = require('express')
      const app = express()
      
      app.get('/', (req, res) => {
        res.send('Hello World!')
      })
      
      app.listen(3000, () => {
        console.log('Server started on port 3000')
      })
      ```

    - Run the command `node index.js` to start your Express.js application.

- Explain the reason as to why Express ‘app’ and ‘server’ must be kept separate.

  - Express "app" and "server" must be kept separate to maintain separation of concerns and modularity. The "server" is responsible for creating and listening to the network socket, while the "app" is responsible for handling incoming requests and producing responses. Separating these concerns allows for more flexibility in the design of your application, as well as better error handling and scalability.

  - In a typical Node.js and Express.js application, the separation of 'app' and 'server' can be achieved by creating two separate files or modules, each responsible for their own functionality. Here's an example of how this can be done:

    1. The 'app' module: This module is responsible for defining the Express.js application and its endpoints.

    ```javascript
    // app.js
    
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    
    // define endpoints
    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
      res.send('Hello World!');
    });
    
    module.exports = app;
    ```

    1. The 'server' module: This module is responsible for creating the HTTP server and listening for incoming requests. It also requires the 'app' module and mounts it on the server.

    ```javascript
    // server.js
    
    const http = require('http');
    const app = require('./app');
    
    const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
    app.set('port', port);
    
    const server = http.createServer(app);
    
    server.listen(port);
    ```

    In the above example, the 'app' module defines the Express.js application and its endpoints. It exports the 'app' object, which can be used by other modules that require it. The 'server' module requires the 'app' module and creates an HTTP server using the 'createServer' method from the 'http' module. It then listens for incoming requests on the specified port and mounts the 'app' on the server using the 'createServer' method.

    By separating the 'app' and 'server' into two separate modules, we have achieved a clear separation of concerns between the different components of the application. This allows for better organization, scalability, testing, and reusability.

- Explain the concept of middleware in Node.js.

  - Middleware in Node.js is a function that sits between the client request and the server response, and can perform various tasks such as modifying the request or response objects, logging requests, authentication, error handling, etc. Middleware functions are executed in the order they are defined, and can be used to modify the behavior of an application without changing the core functionality.
  - Middleware in Node.js is used to provide additional functionality to an application, such as handling authentication, logging, error handling, or modifying the request and response objects. Middleware functions can be added to an Express.js application using the `app.use()` method, and can be written by the developer or obtained from third-party modules. Middleware functions can help to keep the core logic of an application clean and concise, while providing additional functionality that can be shared across different routes and components of the application.
